## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Tailwind CSS v4 with native CSS variables for theming (not v3)
- shadcn/ui "new-york" style variant with copy-paste component files
- Cookie-based i18n (next-intl without URL routing) — NEXT_LOCALE cookie
- Noto Sans font family for multi-script support (Latin + Devanagari + Gujarati)
- Server components by default, client components only when interactivity needed
- FY 2025-26 calendar layout (April-March) for Indian banking fiscal year
- Stacked bar visualization for compliance scorecard (lighter than recharts for print)
- 44px mobile touch targets per WCAG 2.5.5

**Issues Resolved:**

- Tailwind v4 requires @theme inline block for CSS variable colors
- Tailwind v4 does not auto-wrap bare CSS vars in var() for arbitrary values
- Radix UI hydration warnings resolved with suppressHydrationWarning on html tag
- recharts 3.7.0 requires explicit react-is peer dependency with pnpm

**Issues Deferred:**

- Demo data content translations (04-02b) — UI frames translated, JSON content stays English
- DAKSH Submission Screen — listed in PROJECT.md but not implemented (low priority for prototype)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- No real authentication (demo hardcoded login)
- All data from JSON files (no database)
- Some planning docs have stale checkbox states in ROADMAP.md
