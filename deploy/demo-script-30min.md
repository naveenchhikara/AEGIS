## Part 1: Introduction & Login (3 min)

### Context Setting (2 min)

**What to say:**

> "UCBs today face increasing regulatory scrutiny from RBI. The DAKSH portal, mandatory supervisory scores, PCA framework - compliance is no longer optional, it's survival. Most UCBs still manage audits in Excel spreadsheets and Word documents. AEGIS changes that."

> "AEGIS is purpose-built for Urban Cooperative Banks. It understands RBI regulations, speaks your language, and keeps your data in India."

**Key points to cover:**

- RBI's DAKSH supervisory framework for UCBs
- Increasing regulatory requirements (CRAR, NPA norms, KYC/AML, Cyber Security)
- Pain of manual audit tracking and board report preparation
- Cost of non-compliance (PCA restrictions, license cancellation)
