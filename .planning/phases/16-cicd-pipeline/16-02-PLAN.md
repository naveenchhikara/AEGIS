<objective>
Configure GitHub branch protection rules requiring all CI checks to pass before merge, preventing regressions from reaching production.

Purpose: Enforce that no code reaches main without passing automated validation, closing the gap between having CI and actually requiring it.
Output: Branch protection rules on main requiring lint, typecheck, build, e2e status checks.

  <name>Task 1: Configure branch protection rules via gh CLI</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Use the gh CLI to configure branch protection on the main branch. This requires the CI workflow to have run at least once on main (so GitHub recognizes the check names).

**Pre-check:** Verify CI has run by checking for recent workflow runs:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --limit=1
```

If no runs exist, trigger one manually:

```bash
gh workflow run ci.yml --ref main
```

Wait for it to complete before proceeding.

**Configure branch protection:**

```bash
gh api -X PUT "repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection" \
  --input - <<EOF
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["lint", "typecheck", "build", "e2e"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": null,
  "restrictions": null,
  "allow_force_pushes": false,
  "allow_deletions": false
}
EOF
```

**Key details:**

- `strict: true` requires branches to be up-to-date before merging (prevents stale-merge regressions)
- `contexts` lists exact job IDs from ci.yml (lint, typecheck, build, e2e) — NOT deploy (deploy only runs on main, not PRs)
- `enforce_admins: true` applies rules even to repo administrators
- `required_pull_request_reviews: null` does not require PR reviews (solo developer workflow)
- `restrictions: null` does not restrict who can push
- `allow_force_pushes: false` preserves audit trail
- `allow_deletions: false` prevents accidental branch deletion

**If gh CLI auth fails:** This is expected if the GitHub token doesn't have admin:repo permissions. Create a checkpoint for the user to configure manually via GitHub UI:

1. Go to repository Settings -> Branches -> Add branch protection rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Search and select: lint, typecheck, build, e2e
5. Check "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
6. Check "Include administrators"
7. Uncheck "Allow force pushes"
   </action>
   <verify>
   Verify branch protection is set: `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection" --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'`
   Expected output should include: lint, typecheck, build, e2e
   Verify enforce_admins: `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection" --jq '.enforce_admins.enabled'` should return true
   </verify>
   <done>Branch protection rules configured on main requiring lint, typecheck, build, and e2e status checks to pass before merge</done>

  <name>Task 2: Verify CI pipeline and branch protection end-to-end</name>

  <action>
CHECKPOINT: Human verification of complete CI/CD pipeline.

What was built: Complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions workflow (lint, typecheck, build, e2e, deploy) and branch protection rules on main branch.

Verification steps for user:

1. **Verify GitHub Secrets are configured:**
   - Go to GitHub repo -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions
   - Confirm COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL and COOLIFY_API_TOKEN secrets exist (add them if missing)

2. **Verify CI workflow runs:**
   - Go to GitHub repo -> Actions tab
   - Confirm the "CI" workflow appears in the sidebar
   - Check that the most recent run on main shows all 5 jobs (lint, typecheck, build, e2e, deploy)

3. **Test branch protection:**
   - Create a test branch: `git checkout -b test/ci-verify`
   - Make a trivial change (e.g., add a comment to any file)
   - Push and create a PR to main
   - Verify that the PR shows "Required checks" and merge is blocked until they pass
   - Close the PR without merging, delete the test branch

4. **Verify deploy job:**
   - Check the most recent main push workflow run
   - Deploy job should show "Trigger Coolify deployment" step
   - If COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL secret is not set yet, deploy step will fail (expected — set secrets when ready)

Resume signal: Type "approved" if CI pipeline and branch protection work correctly, or describe any issues.
</action>
<verify>User confirms CI pipeline runs on push/PR, branch protection blocks merge without passing checks, deploy job triggers on main</verify>
<done>End-to-end CI/CD pipeline verified: automated testing on every change, branch protection enforced, Coolify deployment triggered on main</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. CI workflow has run successfully on main at least once
2. Branch protection rule exists on main
3. Status checks lint, typecheck, build, e2e are required
4. Force push is disabled on main
5. Admin enforcement is enabled
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- PRs to main show required status checks and cannot merge until all pass
- Force pushes to main are blocked
- Admin users are subject to the same protection rules
- CI pipeline runs automatically on push/PR to main
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/16-cicd-pipeline/16-02-SUMMARY.md`
