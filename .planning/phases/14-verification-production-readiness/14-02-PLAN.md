<objective>
Create VERIFICATION.md reports for Phase 8 (Notifications & Reports), Phase 9 (Dashboards), and Phase 10 (Onboarding & Compliance) following the established template from Phase 11.

Purpose: Phases 8, 9, and 10 are code-complete but lack formal verification documentation. This plan creates evidence-based verification reports that cite file paths, line numbers, and grep results to confirm all 32 requirements are satisfied (16 NOTF/RPT/EXP + 6 DASH + 10 ONBD/CMPL).

Output: Three VERIFICATION.md files with observable truths, required artifacts, key link verification, requirements coverage, anti-patterns check, and build verification.

  <name>Task 1: Create Phase 8 Notifications & Reports VERIFICATION.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/08-notifications-reports/08-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Create a comprehensive verification report for Phase 8 (Notifications & Reports) following the Phase 11 VERIFICATION.md template format.

**Phase 8 Goal:** Users receive email notifications for assignments and deadlines, CAE can generate PDF board reports, and users can export data as formatted Excel files.

**Requirements to verify (16 total):** NOTF-01 through NOTF-06, RPT-01 through RPT-05, EXP-01 through EXP-05.

**Evidence gathering approach:**

1. **Read all 6 plan SUMMARYs** (08-01 through 08-06) to understand what was built.

2. **For each requirement group, grep the codebase:**

   **Notifications (NOTF-01 to NOTF-06):**
   - NOTF-01 (assignment email): grep for observation assignment notification trigger in `src/data-access/notifications.ts` or `src/lib/email/`
   - NOTF-02 (response email): grep for response notification trigger
   - NOTF-03 (deadline reminders): grep for 7d/3d/1d reminder logic, cron job or scheduled task
   - NOTF-04 (escalation email): grep for overdue escalation, supervisor notification
   - NOTF-05 (weekly digest): grep for digest/weekly cron, CAE/CCO recipients
   - NOTF-06 (bulk batching): grep for batch/digest aggregation logic

   **Reports (RPT-01 to RPT-05):**
   - RPT-01 (PDF board report): grep for react-pdf or PDF generation in `src/components/reports/` or `src/data-access/reports.ts`
   - RPT-02 (5 sections): grep for executive summary, audit coverage, key findings, compliance scorecard, recommendations
   - RPT-03 (executive commentary): grep for commentary input field before PDF generation
   - RPT-04 (logo, confidentiality, pages, charts): grep for bank logo, confidentiality notice, page numbers in report template
   - RPT-05 (repeat findings summary): grep for repeat findings in board report section

   **Exports (EXP-01 to EXP-05):**
   - EXP-01 (findings XLSX): grep for XLSX export in findings, check exceljs/xlsx usage
   - EXP-02 (compliance XLSX): grep for compliance export
   - EXP-03 (audit plan XLSX): grep for audit plan export
   - EXP-04 (role permissions): grep for permission check in export actions
   - EXP-05 (bank name, date, confidential header): grep for header formatting in XLSX generation

3. **Verify artifacts exist** with file metrics.
4. **Check key links** between notification triggers, email templates, report generators, and export functions.
5. **Anti-pattern scan** on Phase 8 files.
6. **Build verification.**

**Report structure:** Follow Phase 11 template. Note that AWS SES domain verification is a separate Phase 14 concern -- mark NOTF requirements as "code verified, runtime pending SES verification" where applicable.

Create a comprehensive verification report for Phase 9 (Dashboards) following the Phase 11 VERIFICATION.md template format.

**Phase 9 Goal:** Five role-based dashboards aggregate real-time observation data to show audit coverage, compliance posture, and risk indicators.

**Requirements to verify (6 total):** DASH-01 through DASH-06.

**Evidence gathering approach:**

1. **Read all 5 plan SUMMARYs** (09-01 through 09-05) to understand what was built.

2. **For each requirement, grep the codebase:**
   - DASH-01 (Auditor dashboard): grep for auditor dashboard component, check assigned observations widget, engagement progress, pending responses
   - DASH-02 (Manager dashboard): grep for manager dashboard, check team workload, finding aging, audit plan progress, pending reviews
   - DASH-03 (CAE dashboard): grep for CAE dashboard, check audit coverage, high/critical trends, compliance posture, board report readiness
   - DASH-04 (CCO dashboard): grep for CCO dashboard, check compliance registry status, regulatory calendar, compliance task progress
   - DASH-05 (CEO dashboard): grep for CEO dashboard, check health score, risk indicators, KPIs, read-only
   - DASH-06 (real-time aggregation): grep for data-access/dashboard.ts functions, check they query PostgreSQL (not JSON files)

3. **Verify all 5 dashboard components and their data access functions exist.**
4. **Check key links** between dashboard components and data access layer.
5. **Anti-pattern scan** and build verification.

**Note:** Phase 12 (Dashboard Data Pipeline) already addressed trend widget and engagementId gaps. Reference 12-VERIFICATION.md for trend-related evidence rather than re-verifying.

Create a comprehensive verification report for Phase 10 (Onboarding & Compliance) following the Phase 11 VERIFICATION.md template format.

**Phase 10 Goal:** New banks complete guided onboarding wizard that seeds compliance registry with pre-built RBI checklists based on UCB tier.

**Requirements to verify (10 total):** ONBD-01 through ONBD-06, CMPL-01 through CMPL-04.

**Evidence gathering approach:**

1. **Read all 4 plan SUMMARYs** (10-01 through 10-04) to understand what was built.

2. **For each requirement, grep the codebase:**
   - ONBD-01 (5-step wizard): grep for onboarding wizard steps, check step components (registration, tier selection, RBI directions, org structure, user invites)
   - ONBD-02 (auto-select RBI): grep for tier-based RBI Master Direction selection logic

   - ONBD-04 (user invites with roles): grep for invite user action, role assignment in onboarding
   - ONBD-05 (seed compliance): grep for compliance registry seeding from selected requirements
   - ONBD-06 (save progress): grep for onboarding progress save -- NOTE: Phase 13 completed server-side persistence. Reference 13-VERIFICATION.md.
   - CMPL-01 (pre-built checklists): grep for RBI checklist data in `src/data/rbi-regulations/`
   - CMPL-02 (circular links): grep for circular reference URLs in compliance data
   - CMPL-03 (N/A marking): grep for not-applicable marking action, reason field
   - CMPL-04 (custom requirements): grep for custom requirement creation action

3. **Verify artifacts exist** with file metrics.
4. **Check key links** between onboarding wizard, compliance seeding, and RBI data.
5. **Anti-pattern scan** and build verification.

**Cross-reference Phase 13:** ONBD-03 (Excel upload) and ONBD-06 (server persistence) were completed in Phase 13. Cite 13-VERIFICATION.md and 13-01-SUMMARY.md / 13-02-SUMMARY.md for those requirements. Do not duplicate evidence.
