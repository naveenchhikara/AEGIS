<objective>
Create data structures and demo data for findings, audits, and board reports.

Purpose: Define TypeScript interfaces and populate JSON files with realistic demo data for Phase 3 screens. The findings dataset includes 35 entries with RBI-style observations, the audits dataset includes 8-10 engagements with team assignments and progress, and the reports dataset contains aggregated metrics for board report preview.

Output: Updated types/index.ts and demo data JSON files

       - ExecutiveSummary: { totalAudits: number, completedAudits: number, totalFindings: number, criticalFindings: number, overallRiskLevel: string }
       - AuditCoverage: { planned: AuditCategory[], actual: AuditCategory[] }
       - AuditCategory: { category: string, planned: number, completed: number }
       - KeyFinding: { id: string, title: string, severity: string, brief: string }
       - ComplianceScorecard: { overallScore: number, breakdown: CategoryScore[] }
       - CategoryScore: { category: string, score: number, items: number }
