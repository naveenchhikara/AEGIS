<objective>
Create audit plans and findings demo data.

Purpose: Generate 8-10 planned audits with team assignments and 35 findings with realistic RBI-style observations. Findings reference audits, creating the data relationship chain.

Output: Audit plans and findings data in TypeScript

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create audit plans data</name>
  <files>src/data/audit-plans.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create src/data/audit-plans.ts with 8-10 planned audits:

    Import AuditPlan type from @/types

    Create 8-10 audits covering:
    - Branch Audits (4): Shivaji Nagar, Camp, Karve Nagar, Kothrud
    - IS Audit (1): IT systems and controls
    - Credit Audit (1): Credit department
    - Compliance Audit (1): Regulatory compliance review
    - Revenue Audit (1): Income recognition

    Each audit needs:
    - id: "AUD-001" format
    - name: Descriptive audit name
    - type: branch-audit, is-audit, credit-audit, compliance-audit, revenue-audit
    - branchId: Reference to branch from bank profile (for branch audits)
    - departmentId: Reference to department (for department audits)
    - plannedStartDate: Various dates in Q1-Q2 2026
    - plannedEndDate: 2-4 weeks after start
    - assignedTeam: 2-4 staff member names from bank profile
    - status: Mix of not-started, in-progress, on-hold
    - progress: 0-100 (based on status)
    - createdAt: "2026-01-15"

    Export: export const auditPlans: AuditPlan[] = [ ... ]

  <name>Task 2: Create findings data</name>
  <files>src/data/findings.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create src/data/findings.ts with 35 findings:

    Import Finding type from @/types

    Create 35 findings using patterns from common-rbi-observations.md:
    - Critical (5): Serious control gaps, regulatory violations
    - High (10): Significant weaknesses needing urgent action
    - Medium (12): Moderate issues requiring improvement
    - Low (8): Minor observations

    Categories:
    - Governance: Board oversight, committee meetings, policy gaps
    - Operations: Cash handling, concurrent audit issues, documentation
    - Credit: Loan classification, provisioning delays, priority sector gaps
    - IT: Access control, backup issues, patch management
    - Compliance: Regulatory reporting, RBI circular implementation

    Each finding needs:
    - id: "FIND-001" format
    - auditId: Reference to audit from audit plans
    - title: Concise finding title
    - category: governance, operations, credit, it, compliance
    - severity: critical, high, medium, low
    - status: Mix of draft, under-review, response-pending, action-planned
    - observation: Detailed RBI-style observation
    - rootCause: Why it occurred
    - riskImpact: What's the risk
    - auditeeResponse: Plausible response
    - actionPlan: Steps to fix
    - assignedAuditor: Staff member from bank profile
    - createdAt: "2026-01-15" or later
    - updatedAt: Same or later than createdAt
    - timeline: 2-5 status change entries

    Export: export const findings: Finding[] = [ ... ]
  </action>
  <verify>File exists with 35 findings with realistic RBI-style observations</verify>
  <done>35 findings created with severity levels and RBI-style content</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update data index</name>
  <files>src/data/index.ts</files>
  <action>
    Update src/data/index.ts to include new modules:

    Add re-exports:
    export * from './audit-plans'
    export * from './findings'

    The file should now export: bankProfile, complianceRequirements, auditPlans, findings
  </action>
  <verify>File exports auditPlans and findings in addition to existing modules</verify>
  <done>Data index updated with audit plans and findings</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- 8-10 audit plans with different types
- 35 findings with RBI-style observations
- Findings reference valid audit IDs
- Staff members referenced from bank profile
- Data index exports all modules
- TypeScript types match data structure
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Audit plans: 8-10 audits with team assignments and progress
- Findings: 35 findings with realistic RBI observations (critical/high/medium/low)
- Data relationships: auditId references valid audits, staff references valid bank profile staff
- All data imports without TypeScript errors
</success_criteria>
