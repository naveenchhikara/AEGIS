<objective>
Expand demo data: Add 25 more findings (for total of 35) and 35 more compliance requirements (for total of 50) to meet success criteria for the clickable prototype.

Purpose: The success criteria require "35 findings" and "50+ compliance requirements" to demonstrate a realistic audit management scenario during demos. The current 10 findings and 15 requirements are insufficient.
Output: Updated findings.json with 35 entries and updated compliance-requirements.json with 50 entries.

  <name>Task 1: Expand findings from 10 to 35</name>
  <files>src/data/demo/findings.json</files>
  <action>
    Add 25 new findings (FND-011 through FND-035) to the existing 10 findings in findings.json. Keep the existing 10 findings EXACTLY as-is — append new ones after FND-010.

    **Each finding MUST follow the existing Finding type shape:**
    ```typescript
    {
      id: string,          // FND-011 through FND-035
      auditId: string,     // Reference existing audit IDs: AUD-001 through AUD-008
      title: string,       // Concise RBI-style finding title
      category: string,    // One of: Capital Adequacy, Asset Liability Management, Cyber Security, Credit Risk, Operations, Governance, Treasury, Priority Sector Lending, Deposit Operations
      severity: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low",
      status: "draft" | "submitted" | "reviewed" | "responded" | "closed",
      observation: string, // 2-3 sentences describing the finding in RBI audit language
      rootCause: string,   // 2-3 sentences explaining why this happened
      riskImpact: string,  // 2-3 sentences on regulatory/business risk
      auditeeResponse: string, // Management response or "Awaiting management response"
      actionPlan: string,  // Numbered action items or "Pending management response"
      assignedAuditor: string, // Use staff names: "Priya Sharma", "Vikram Kulkarni", "Suresh Patil", "Amit Joshi"
      targetDate: string,  // ISO 8601 date between 2025-12-01 and 2026-06-30
      createdAt: string,   // ISO 8601 date between 2025-06-01 and 2025-12-31
      updatedAt: string,   // ISO 8601 date, same or later than createdAt
      timeline: FindingTimeline[], // 1-5 events with id, date, action, actor
      relatedCircular: string, // One of: RBI/2023-24/117, RBI/2022-23/153, RBI/2021-22/108, RBI/2023-24/89, RBI/2021-22/65, RBI/2022-23/76
      relatedRequirement: string // E.g., CAP-001, CR-004, CYB-001, etc.
    }
    ```

    **Target severity distribution for all 35 findings:**
    - Critical: 3 (existing 1 + 2 new)
    - High: 8 (existing 3 + 5 new)
    - Medium: 14 (existing 4 + 10 new)
    - Low: 10 (existing 2 + 8 new)

    **Target status distribution for all 35 findings:**
    - Draft: 5 (existing 1 + 4 new)
    - Submitted: 6 (existing 2 + 4 new)
    - Reviewed: 7 (existing 2 + 5 new)
    - Responded: 9 (existing 3 + 6 new)
    - Closed: 8 (existing 2 + 6 new)

    **Target category distribution (expand beyond existing 6 categories):**
    - Capital Adequacy: 3
    - Asset Liability Management: 2
    - Cyber Security: 4
    - Credit Risk: 7
    - Operations: 7
    - Governance: 4
    - Treasury: 3
    - Priority Sector Lending: 3
    - Deposit Operations: 2

    **Realistic UCB finding topics to use (pick from these):**
    - Loan documentation deficiencies in gold loan portfolio
    - SLR/CRR maintenance shortfall
    - Non-compliance with priority sector lending targets
    - Inadequate IT change management process
    - Board meeting minutes not maintained properly
    - Investment portfolio valuation discrepancies
    - Fixed deposit premature withdrawal procedure gaps
    - Locker agreement irregularities
    - Staff rotation policy not implemented
    - Delayed CTR/STR filing to FIU-IND
    - Inadequate internal control over fund transfer (NEFT/RTGS)
    - NPA classification not as per RBI timelines
    - Subordinate debt compliance gaps
    - Interest rate risk documentation gaps
    - Non-performing assets recovery monitoring
    - Security audit of internet banking not done
    - Whistle-blower mechanism not operationalized
    - Branch audit coverage below 100%
    - Treasury operations without separate front/back office
    - Depreciation on investments not calculated correctly
    - CBS data backup verification not tested
    - Overdue bills not followed up
    - Concentration risk in deposit base
    - Customer grievance redressal mechanism gaps
    - Annual financial inspection preparation gaps

    **Timeline events per finding:**
    - Draft findings: 1 event (creation only)
    - Submitted: 2 events (creation + submission)
    - Reviewed: 3 events (creation + submission + review)
    - Responded: 3-4 events (creation + submission + response + possible follow-up)
    - Closed: 3-5 events (full lifecycle)

    **Update the summary section** to reflect all 35 findings:
    ```json
    "summary": {
      "total": 35,
      "bySeverity": { "critical": 3, "high": 8, "medium": 14, "low": 10 },
      "byStatus": { "draft": 5, "submitted": 6, "reviewed": 7, "responded": 9, "closed": 8 },
      "byCategory": {
        "Capital Adequacy": 3, "Asset Liability Management": 2, "Cyber Security": 4,
        "Credit Risk": 7, "Operations": 7, "Governance": 4,
        "Treasury": 3, "Priority Sector Lending": 3, "Deposit Operations": 2
      },
      "lastUpdated": "2025-12-31"
    }
    ```

    **IMPORTANT:** Actor names in timeline events should use staff names from staff.json: Priya Sharma, Amit Joshi, Vikram Kulkarni, Suresh Patil, Meena Naik, Deepak Ghorpade, Rajesh Deshmukh, Subhash Jadhav, Rahul Joshi.

    **IMPORTANT:** Distribute findings across audit IDs (AUD-001 through AUD-008) realistically — more findings for completed/in-progress audits, fewer or none for planned/cancelled ones.

    - `node -e "const d = require('./src/data/demo/findings.json'); console.log('Total:', d.findings.length); console.log('Summary total:', d.summary.total)"` outputs Total: 35, Summary total: 35
    - `node -e "const d = require('./src/data/demo/findings.json'); const s = {}; d.findings.forEach(f => s[f.severity] = (s[f.severity]||0)+1); console.log(s)"` shows correct severity distribution
    - `pnpm build` passes
  </verify>
  <done>
    - 35 findings in findings.json with realistic RBI-style observations
    - All findings follow the Finding type shape exactly
    - Summary counts match actual data
    - Timeline events present for every finding
    - Findings distributed across audit IDs

  <name>Task 2: Expand compliance requirements from 15 to 50</name>
  <files>src/data/demo/compliance-requirements.json</files>
  <action>
    Add 35 new compliance requirements (CMP-016 through CMP-050) to the existing 15 in compliance-requirements.json. Keep existing 15 EXACTLY as-is — append new ones after CMP-015.

    **Each requirement MUST follow the existing ComplianceRequirement type shape:**
    ```typescript
    {
      id: string,              // CMP-016 through CMP-050
      categoryId: string,      // E.g., CAP-005, RISK-003, CR-006, MR-002, GOV-005, CYB-005, OPS-005, etc.
      title: string,           // Short compliance requirement title
      description: string,     // 1-2 sentences describing the requirement
      reference: string,       // RBI circular reference
      status: "compliant" | "partial" | "non-compliant" | "pending",
      dueDate: string,         // ISO 8601 date
      evidenceCount: number,   // 0-8
      assignedTo: string,      // Staff username like "amit.joshi"
      assignedToName: string,  // Full name like "Amit Joshi"
      priority: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low",
      lastReviewDate: string,
      nextReviewDate: string,
      notes: string,
      createdAt: string,
      updatedAt: string
    }
    ```

    **Target status distribution for all 50 requirements:**
    - Compliant: 25 (existing 7 + 18 new)
    - Partial: 10 (existing 3 + 7 new)
    - Non-Compliant: 8 (existing 3 + 5 new)
    - Pending: 7 (existing 2 + 5 new)

    **New categoryId prefixes to add (beyond existing CAP, RISK, CR, MR, GOV, CYB):**
    - OPS (Operations): OPS-001 through OPS-006
    - DEP (Deposit): DEP-001 through DEP-003
    - TSY (Treasury): TSY-001 through TSY-003
    - PSL (Priority Sector Lending): PSL-001 through PSL-003
    - AML (Anti-Money Laundering): AML-001 through AML-003
    - HR (Human Resources/Staff): HR-001 through HR-002

    **Realistic UCB compliance requirement topics:**
    - Priority sector lending target compliance (40% of advances)
    - CTR/STR filing timeliness with FIU-IND
    - Customer grievance redressal mechanism
    - Deposit insurance coverage with DICGC
    - Board meeting frequency (minimum quarterly)
    - Whistle-blower policy implementation
    - Staff rotation in sensitive positions
    - Interest rate transparency guidelines
    - Investment portfolio classification and valuation
    - NPA recognition and provisioning norms
    - Fit and proper criteria for directors
    - SLR/CRR maintenance
    - CBS uptime and data backup
    - Locker management guidelines
    - Internet banking security controls

    **Update the summary section** to reflect all 50 requirements:
    ```json
    "summary": {
      "total": 50,
      "compliant": 25,
      "partial": 10,
      "non-compliant": 8,

      },
      "lastUpdated": "2025-12-31"
    }
    ```

    **IMPORTANT:** Use the existing staff members for assignedTo/assignedToName. Distribute assignments realistically across:
    - Amit Joshi (compliance officer)
    - Priya Sharma (chief auditor)
    - Vikram Kulkarni (IT)
    - Suresh Patil (credit)
    - Meena Naik (treasury)
