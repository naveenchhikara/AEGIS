<objective>
Conduct a final re-audit of all 59 v2.0 requirements, update the traceability table in REQUIREMENTS.md, confirm 0 HIGH tech debt, and update STATE.md to mark Phase 14 and the v2.0 Gap Closure milestone as complete.

Purpose: This is the capstone verification that confirms the entire v2.0 milestone is done. It cross-references all VERIFICATION.md files (phases 5-13) to produce a definitive requirement-by-requirement status assessment.

Output: Updated REQUIREMENTS.md with all 59 requirements marked, updated STATE.md with Phase 14 completion.

  <name>Task 1: Re-audit all 59 requirements and update traceability</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Conduct a systematic re-audit of all 59 v2.0 requirements by cross-referencing the VERIFICATION.md files for each phase.

**Process:**

1. **Read all VERIFICATION.md files** from phases 5-13 (9 files total).

2. **For each requirement, determine status:**
   - **Satisfied** — VERIFICATION.md shows requirement verified with evidence
   - **Partial** — Requirement partially implemented, gaps identified
   - **Pending** — Not yet implemented
   - **N/A** — Not applicable (should not happen for v2.0 requirements)

3. **Cross-reference gap closures:**
   - Phase 11 closes FNDN-02 and FNDN-03 security gaps (rate limiting, lockout, sessions, cookies)
   - Phase 12 closes DASH-03 and DASH-05 trend widget gaps, RPT-05 repeat findings gap
   - Phase 13 closes ONBD-03 (Excel upload) and ONBD-06 (server persistence) gaps

4. **Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table:**
   Change each requirement's status from "Pending" to the assessed status:

   ```markdown
   | Requirement | Phase   | Status    |
   | ----------- | ------- | --------- |
   | FNDN-01     | Phase 5 | Satisfied |
   | FNDN-02     | Phase 5 | Satisfied |

   ...
   ```

   Also update the checkbox next to each requirement definition:
   - `- [x] **FNDN-01**:` for Satisfied
   - `- [ ] **FNDN-01**:` for Partial/Pending

5. **Check for HIGH tech debt:**
   Review STATE.md Gap -> Phase Mapping table. All items should be "DONE". Confirm 0 HIGH-severity items remain open.

6. **Produce audit summary** as a comment block at the bottom of REQUIREMENTS.md:

   ```markdown
   ## Audit Summary

   **Audit Date:** 2026-02-10
   **Auditor:** Claude (gsd-verifier)
   **Total Requirements:** 59
   **Satisfied:** X/59
   **Partial:** Y/59
   **Pending:** Z/59
   **HIGH Tech Debt:** 0

   ### Verification Coverage

   | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | Score |
   | ----- | --------------- | ----- |
   | 5     | Yes             | X/Y   |
   | 6     | Yes             | X/Y   |

   ...
   | 13 | Yes | X/Y |
   ```

**Target: 59/59 Satisfied and 0 HIGH tech debt.** If any requirement is not Satisfied, document the specific gap and what remains.

<verify>

- All 59 requirements have status in traceability table: `grep -c "Satisfied\|Partial\|Pending" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` returns >= 59
- No "Pending" status remains: `grep -c "Pending" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` in traceability section returns 0
- Audit summary exists: `grep "Audit Summary" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` returns match
- Checkboxes updated: `grep -c "\[x\]" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` returns >= 55
