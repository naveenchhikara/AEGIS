# Requirements: AEGIS v2.0 Working Core MVP

**Defined:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** Individual audit observations flow upward through a structured lifecycle to form the complete risk and compliance picture — from a single branch finding to the board report.

- [x] **OBS-08**: User can tag observation across multiple dimensions (risk category, RBI requirement, audit area, severity, branch)
- [x] **OBS-09**: System detects potential repeat findings by matching branch + audit area + risk category
- [x] **OBS-10**: Repeat finding severity auto-escalates (2nd occurrence +1 level, 3rd occurrence = Critical)

### Auditee Portal

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature                                     | Reason                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generic configurable workflow engine        | UCB audit lifecycle is standardized by RBI; hardcode the state machine      |
| Real-time chat / discussion threads         | Undermines structured observation lifecycle; use formal responses instead   |
| Mobile native app                           | Responsive web sufficient; Tier III/IV UCBs use desktop at branch offices   |
| CBS integration (Finacle/Flexcube)          | Requires CBS vendor cooperation; defer to post-pilot                        |
| AI-powered risk scoring                     | Requires large training datasets; UCB data is too small; rule-based instead |
| On-premise deployment                       | SaaS-only business model; data localization via AWS Mumbai                  |
| Document versioning / collaborative editing | CAE generates point-in-time PDF; no real-time collaboration needed          |
| Custom report builder                       | RBI RBIA format is standardized; pre-built templates sufficient             |
| Offline mode / PWA                          | UCB offices have internet; optimize for slow connections instead            |
| DAKSH API integration                       | Start with formatted export for manual upload                               |

**Total:** All 59 requirements verified with evidence citations.

### Gap Closure

All identified gaps from Phases 5, 9, and 10 have been closed:

**Phase 5 Security Gaps (Closed in Phase 11):**

- ✅ Rate limiting configured (10 attempts/15min per IP)
- ✅ Account lockout implemented (5 failures → 30-min lock with auto-unlock)
- ✅ Concurrent session limit enforced (max 2 sessions per user)
- ✅ Session cookie security explicit (httpOnly, secure, sameSite=lax)

**Phase 9 Dashboard Gaps (Closed in Phase 12):**

- ✅ Trend widgets now query historical data from DashboardSnapshot table
- ✅ Observation.engagementId FK added for engagement progress tracking
- ✅ Board report repeat findings section populated with repeatOfId query

**Phase 10 Onboarding Gaps (Closed in Phase 13):**

- ✅ ONBD-03: Excel org structure upload implemented with template download + upload + parse
- ✅ ONBD-06: Server-side onboarding save/load with localStorage merge (server wins if newer)

### Evidence Quality

All requirements have:

- ✓ Observable truth statements with evidence citations (file:line)
- ✓ Required artifacts verified (substantive implementations, 15+ lines minimum)
- ✓ Key link verification (imports and function calls traced)
- ✓ Anti-pattern checks passed (no TODO/FIXME/stubs in production code)
- ✓ Build verification passed (`pnpm build` successful for all phases)

### Production Readiness

**Code-Complete:** All 59 requirements implemented and verified at code level.

**Runtime Verification:** Phases 5–14 code-complete. Full E2E runtime testing documented in Phase 14 VERIFICATION reports. Human verification checkpoints identified for browser testing, email delivery, and multi-device testing.

**Known Limitations:**

- AWS SES domain verification pending (DNS propagation lead time) — email sending code-complete but runtime email delivery untested
- Test accounts require password "TestPassword123!" for Better Auth authentication in E2E tests

**Recommendation:** All v2.0 requirements satisfied. Project ready for Phase 15 (production deployment preparation) or pilot deployment.
