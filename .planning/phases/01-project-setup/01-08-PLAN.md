<objective>
Create bank profile and compliance requirements demo data.

Purpose: Generate realistic JSON data for Sahyadri UCB bank profile (branches, departments, staff) and 50+ RBI compliance requirements across all regulatory categories. These are the foundational data structures that other features depend on.

Output: Bank profile data and 50+ compliance requirements in TypeScript

    - shortName: "Sahyadri UCB"
    - established: "1985-06-15" (ISO date)

  <name>Task 2: Create compliance requirements data</name>
  <files>src/data/compliance-requirements.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create src/data/compliance-requirements.ts with 50+ RBI requirements:

    Import ComplianceRequirement type from @/types

    Create 50+ requirements covering:
    - Risk Management (8-10): Basel III, risk committee, ICAAP, stress testing
    - Governance (8-10): board composition, fit & proper, audit committee, internal controls
    - Operations (8-10): cash management, housekeeping, concurrent audit, safeguarding assets
    - IT (8-10): IT governance, IS audit, cyber security, business continuity
    - Credit (8-10): loan classification, provisioning, priority sector, NPAs
    - Market Risk (6-8): interest rate risk, ALM, investment portfolio

    Each requirement needs:
    - id: "RBI-001" format
    - categoryId: "risk", "governance", "operations", "it", "credit", "market-risk"
    - title: Descriptive title
    - description: Full requirement text
    - reference: "RBI Circular [date] - [subject]"
    - status: Mix of compliant, partial, non-compliant, pending
    - dueDate: Various dates in 2026
    - evidenceCount: Random 0-15
    - assignedTo: Staff member from bank profile
    - createdAt: "2026-01-01"

    Use RBI circular references from RESEARCH.md types.

  <name>Task 3: Create data index</name>
  <files>src/data/index.ts</files>

    Create src/data/index.ts as central export point:

    Re-export all data modules for easy importing:
